\section{Plenary Speakers}

\subsection{Prof.~Ian Griffiths, University of Oxford, UK}

\subsubsection{How can mathematics help us keep the world clean? (Stewartson Memorial Lecture)}

World cleaning applies to air, water and land: In the wake of the pandemic and the potential for future pandemics, how can we predict the risk of catching a virus in an indoor setting and how do antiviral air purifiers mitigate this risk?; The continued increase in water scarcity prompts us to seek better ways of providing clean water; And the novichok chemical warfare incident in 2018 motivates questions on how one adequately cleans up a chemical spill. In this talk, we use a variety of mathematical modelling techniques - some simple, others more complicated - to provide answers to these questions and others as we seek strategies to keep our world clean.

\subsubsection{Biography}

Ian Griffiths obtained his doctorate at the University of Oxford where he studied the mathematics of glass tube manufacture. He subsequently completed postdocs at Durham and Princeton University before become a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Oxford. His research accomplishments include modelling the performance of water filters for developing countries, which now serve more than 150,000 people, and producing mathematical models that are used in the design of Samsung and Huawei mobile phone screens. He is now a Professor of Industrial Mathematics at Oxford and the Janet Dyson Fellow of Mathematics at Mansfield College.

\subsection{Dr.~Adriana Dawes, Ohio State University, USA}

\subsubsection{Quantifying approximate symmetries in biological systems}

What do leaves and human faces have in common? What about daisies and sea urchins? They possess bilateral and rotational symmetries! Symmetry is a fundamental feature of natural systems, and is often correlated with survival, fecundity, and evolvability. While symmetry is ubiquitous and often intuitively obvious, symmetry in biological organisms is rarely perfect, making it challenging to apply mathematical definitions of idealized symmetry. To address this challenge, we developed a flexible, entropy-based method for quantifying symmetry that requires very little user input. I will highlight some novel insights arising from applications of this measure, including evidence for convergent evolution in flowering plants, classification of biopolymer networks, and visualization of the emergence and loss of symmetries in pattern formation systems.

\subsubsection{Biography}

Professor Dawes is a faculty member at the Ohio State University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Molecular Genetics. Prof. Dawes' research uses rigorous mathematical tools to uncover fundamental regulatory mechanisms in cell and developmental biology, with a particular focus on understanding how cells integrate biochemical, mechanical, and geometric information to make appropriate cell fate decisions. Prof. Dawes is a former Associate Director of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute, serves as senior editor at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, is the holder of a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation (USA), and is currently funded by the National Institutes of Health (USA).

\subsection{Dr.~Ellen Brooks Pollock, University of Bristol, UK}

\subsubsection{William Budd and 150 years of thinking about disease transmission}

William Budd was a physician at the Bristol Infirmary in the 19th century. He observed first-hand the devastating 1849 cholera epidemic in England and argued against prevailing miasma theory that infectious diseases were caused by foul smells, and instead made the case that an infectious agent was responsible. In this talk, I will re-examine Budd’s largely forgotten contribution to infectious disease theory and how he concluded that preventing transmission between infectious and susceptible individuals was the key to disease control. I will discuss approaches and challenges for describing disease transmission mathematically and how these ideas were used during the 2019 COVID pandemic to characterize transmission and shape the response. I will discuss methodology we developed during the pandemic to map social contact patterns to population—level epidemic metrics, and a specific example of modelling of COVID-19 transmission at the University of Bristol based on detailed social contact data.   
\subsubsection{Biography}

Ellen is an Associate Professor in Infectious Disease Modelling at the University of Bristol. She did an MSci in Mathematics at University College London in the previous century before completing her PhD on bovine tuberculosis and cattle movements at the University of Warwick. She has toured great institutions such as Harvard University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Cambridge before joining the University of Bristol as a lecturer in 2015. She is interested in developing data-driven models that challenge intuition and reveal truths about the world around us. She was heavily involved in the UK COVID modelling response for which she received an OBE in the 2021 Queen’s Birthday Honours list.  

\subsection{Prof.~Brian Wetton, University of British Columbia, Canada}

\subsubsection{Enthalpy Methods for Moving Boundary Problems}

We present the well understood Stefan and Oxygen Depletion Problems as examples of explicit and implicit moving boundary value problems respectively. We show the different ways these problems can be analyzed and computed numerically with a focus on the Enthalpy Method (a grid capturing technique). Generalized problems are shown, including two phase flow in porous media and the formation of sea ice. Rigorous analysis of the problems and their numerical approximation is missing in many of these generalized problems. 

\subsubsection{Biography}

Brian Wetton is a Professor in the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia. His awards include the 1992 NYU Kurt O. Friedrichs Prize, the 2000 Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences Industrial Outreach Prize, the 2008 UBC Alan Blizzard Award, and the 2010 CAIMS/MITACS Industrial Research Prize. The industrial mathematics awards were recognition of his leadership role in a fuel cell modelling project with Ballard Power Systems that had both industry and MITACS NCE funding. He was the director of the UBC Institute of Applied Mathematics (2013-2018). Mathematical modelling of electrochemical systems has been a major application of his modelling, asymptotic, and scientific computing skills: the expertise in this area has been applied to fuel cells, generalized dialysis devices, and currently Li-ion batteries.

\subsection{Prof.~James Gleeson, University of Limerick, Ireland}

\subsubsection{Data-driven modelling of cascades on networks (IMA Lighthill Lecture)}

Network models may be applied to describe many complex systems, and in the era of online social networks the study of dynamics on networks is an important branch of computational social science.  Cascade dynamics can occur when the state of a node is affected by the states of its neighbours in the network, for example when a Twitter user is inspired to retweet a message that she received from a user she follows, with one event (the retweet) potentially causing further events (retweets by followers of followers) in a chain reaction. In this talk I will review some mathematical models that can help us understand how social contagion (the spread of cultural fads and the viral diffusion of information) depends upon the structure of the social network and on the dynamics of human behaviour. Although the models are simple enough to allow for mathematical analysis, I will show examples where they can also provide good matches to empirical observations of cascades on social networks.

\subsubsection{Biography}

James Gleeson holds the Chair in Industrial and Applied Mathematics at the University of Limerick. As a member and former co-director of MACSI, the Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and Industry, he leads research into applications of mathematics to real-world problems with significant economic and social impact. James is a graduate of University College Dublin in Mathematical Sciences and Mathematical Physics and received his PhD in Applied Mathematics from California Institute of Technology in 1999. Following his graduation from Caltech, he held positions as a visiting assistant professor in Arizona State University, postdoctoral research positions in the Department of Applied Mathematics at University College Cork (UCC) and National Microelectronic Research Centre (now Tyndall Institute) in Cork, and as a senior lecturer in the School of Mathematical Sciences, UCC before moving to Limerick in 2007. His research interests are in mathematical modelling, particularly of stochastic dynamics on complex networks.

\subsection{Prof.~Zoe Doulgeri, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece}

\subsubsection{Shared control in physical human-robot interaction applications (Public lecture)}

Over the last decades industrial robots have been widely deployed in the manufacturing industry, relieving workers from repetitive, unhealthy or arduous jobs with their workspace being strictly separated from that of humans for safety. Collaborative robots is a new generation of industrial robots that can work along side and with humans as co-workers or assistants. These robots are expected to provide flexibility by extending robot applications beyond the isolated structured work cells.  Collaborative robots should provide assistance to humans by reducing their physical and/or cognitive load, while being safe during their co-existence and collaboration with humans. In this talk, we will present shared control applications for resolving the problem of intentional physical human-robot interaction. The presentation will focus on the use of shared control methods for facilitating the human towards the kinesthetic teaching of a task, co-manipulating objects and progressive automation.

\subsubsection{Biography}

Zoe Doulgeri is a Professor of Robotics and Control of Manufacturing Systems and the director of the Automation and Robotics Lab of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH).
